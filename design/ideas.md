# Red Planet

## Idea #1: Missile Defense

- Lots of fancy partile effects, glow/bloom effects, high res vector graphics
- Defending cities/colonies below
- Also hit UFO's but avoid collateral damage
- Should also have defending planes that you have to avoid
- Weapons: 
  - Rocket: Large blast radius, medium fire rate
  - Machine gun: precise, bullets move as particles, has cooldown if shot too long
  - Rail gun: super fast and precise, powerful, very slow firing rate. 

### Risk Factors
- Too derivative?
- Making fun/interesting -- how to make unique

## Idea #2: Chop Lifter

- Shoot down ufos and bring civilians to safety
- 2d physics for realism
  - Flappy-bird style maintaining of altitude - no hover button
  - Ladders for rescue have string physics
    - Could get tied up on ufo
    - IF you don't hold still, people can't climb it, and people might fall off
- Battle UFOs
  - UFO's have weak spots
    - Pilot bubble
    - Levitation thing
- Shoot martians on the ground
  - Defend location
  - Army troops, help them advance
- Weapons: 
  - Machine gun - Good for targetting weak spots, minimal aiming -- mostly shoots front, does very little damage to hull of UFO, does not change momentum of UFO -- infinite ammo, useful for ground support
  - Rockets - Good for hull damage, changes momentum of UFO, limited capacity
  - Combo rockets TODO
  - Grenade Launcher TODO
  - Net - Temporarily incapacitate ufo, hold it to ground, possibly attach bombs as upgrade. 

Upgrade system: TODO

Possible Upgrades:
  - Fucking Lazer!
  - Railgun -- significant recoil

Other ideas:
  - Speech bubbles above civilians, soldiers, UFOs, Space Dogs

### Risk Factors
- Tuning physics
- Risk mitigation: SVG, we can embed level info in XML attributes
- Animations might be tricky

## Idea #3: Space RTS, earth vs. mars

- 3d on a flat plane
- Earth has more resources & ships, but weaker ships and technology
- Martians (as humans) have better tech, but less ships, more expensive
- New Australia!!!!!
- Battles: Two capital ships, upgrade weapons, systems, etc.
- Most fights between squadrons
  - Rock Paper Scissors
    - Fighters
    - Bombers
    - Gunships

### Risk Factors:

- AI Could be tricky/time consuming
- Panda3D is easy but neither of us know it well
- Map editor? 3d modeller as level design tool
- JSON w/ comments / YAML / ini files to describe units

## Idea #4: Battlezone style First Person RTS

- 
### Risk Factors

- Enemy AI

## Idea #5: Journey to Mars

- Oregon Trailish
- What sort of encounters and mini games?
  - Fixing ship and maintaining

### Risk factors:

- How many encounter types, how to keep encounter types interesting in space
- How many mini-games?

## Idea #6: Earth vs. Mars

- Solar system
  - Launch attacks on other planet, using physics w/ gravity, place defenses in orbit
- Star castle inspiration
